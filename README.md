## TODO
For now, I'll implement some basic maze generation and pathfinding algorithms, here's what's left:
- Implement maze generation algorithms:
    - [ ] Recursive Backtracking
    - [ ] Prim's
    - [X] Noise Map *(the only one I actually know how to implement)*<br/>
- Implement pathfinding algorithms:
    - [X] A*
    - [ ] BFS
    - [ ] Dijkstra's
- Code Cleanup (this project is held together with bad coding practices, hopes, and prayers.)
