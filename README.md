# mavis

`mavis` (or <ins>**ma**</ins>ze-<ins>**vis**</ins>ualizer) is a maze and pathfinding algorithm visualization TUI app built with Rust ðŸ¦€!

## TODO
For now, I'll implement some basic maze generation and pathfinding algorithms, here's what's left:
- Implement maze generation algorithms:
    - [ ] Recursive Backtracking
    - [ ] Prim's
    - [ ] Noise Map *(the only one I actually know how to implement)*<br/>
- Implement pathfinding algorithms:
    - [ ] A*
    - [ ] BFS
    - [ ] Dijkstra's
